**Project Name: Java Play Games** 

This project is made with java. In this project, I added an interface that will show all the games. Users can click on the game logos which game the user wants to play. Then a new window will open for the selected game. It is my first Java Project on games. Initially, I added four common games. The games are, 

1) Snake Game 
1) Brick Breaker Game 
1) A 2d car racing game 
1) Space shooter 

**JDK Version & IDE:** 

1) JDK 1.8 (32 bit Version) 
1) NetBeans IDE 8.2 RC 

**Java Libraries:**  

1) Java Swing 
1) Java awt 
1) Java Graphics 
1) Java Graphics2D 

**Note: No external library is used in this project.** 

**Features:** 

1) The above four games will be linked to one file. The user doesnâ€™t need to open each file of the game to play. 
1) A GUI window will be created and users can see all the games with logos included in that GUI window. 
1) In the future, this project can be developed, and new games can be added. Not only games but also apps can be added to this project. 

**My Contribution:** 

1) A GUI to display the games. 
1) Almost in all games, 

   I have tried to add difficulties, levels, and a menu that includes START Button, Exit Button, and display key controls so that users can easily play the games. 

3) In Space Shooter Game, I added mouse controls, restart button, player life, collisions, player image, enemy plane images, difficulties. 
3) In Car Game. I added keyboard controls, player image, other cars image, collisions, difficulties.  
3) Both Space Shooter Game and Car Game has no limit, the cars and planes generated randomly but the higher score goes more difficulties will come. 
3) The Brick Breaker and The Snake games have limit. The Brick Breaker Game has 6 levels. The Snake game has 3 levels. After completing all the games game over message will be shown. There is only one chance to complete the game. If any user fails in any point of the game, the progress will not be saved and user have to play the game again from the first level.
